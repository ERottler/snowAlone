# snowAlone

Fortran Console Application snow model based on the energy balance method to calcluate the dynamics of the snow cover presented in ECHSE (Eco-hydrological Simulation Environment). This reposity inlcudes all files related to the standalone snow model 'snowAlone', including R-scripts to create synthetic input data and visualize model output. The development of snowAlone constituted a first step of the implementation of a snow routine into the hydrological model WASA-SED.
